							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that identifying the purpose of your design is the 1st essential step. The allignment between typography and purpose is also interesting in what makes a "good" design since it can help set a mood and tone. The font inspiration resources was pretty informative too since I wasn't aware that there was a vast database for fonts.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed how thorough this article was in terms of dissecting what goes into typography. My favorite part of this article is the font breakdown. I was fascinated with the different recommended fonts by the intended audience/project. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Choose fonts that are conventional and easy to read. Avoid highly decorative fonts in favor of simple and practical fonts. Also, be mindful of the purpose of a font. For example, some fonts are more suited to be headers rather than body text.

								For this reason, before choosing a font, research its intended purpose." </p>
