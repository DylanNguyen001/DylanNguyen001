					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility allows for people with vision impairments to interact with digital experiences the same way that non-vision impaired people can the same way. Before reading this article, I had no idea that lawsuits have been filed due to a lack of appropriate accessibility for websites. Some software and tools can assist in background color/accessibility.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the incorporation of "do this" and "don't do this" elements. The inclusion of these parts is helpful as it allows me to know how to improve our designs for accessibility. Seeing the different factors needed for accessibility and the different guidelines is handy.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least 814 federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I'd rate this article 7. Again, I enjoyed the contrast in what parts are effective and which ones aren't.</p>
