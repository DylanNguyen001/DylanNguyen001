						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned from this article that visual design and psychology are linked. Our brains tend to make associations when we look at unusually shaped objects. This connects to Gestalt, or a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in the 1920s that a 'whole' is viewed greater than the sum of parts. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article is seeing the opening paragraph with the images of the clouds. This introduction sets up the concepts discussed throughout the article: psychology in relation to visual design. Seeing how these concepts connect to what we're doing in class is pretty interesting too.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?” </p>
							<p> — Laura Busche, Brand Content Strategist at Autodesk </p>
