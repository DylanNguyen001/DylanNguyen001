                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article, I learned about some UI designs to take some inspiration from. This is handy as we as readers can get a glimpse on suitable designs of today. I also learned that there's a variety of designs and UI implementations to consider that can suit various kinds of uses.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was the opportunity to glance at various kinds of designs. I thought it was especially cool to see their implementation and prototypes on actual devices. For instance, I found the "Welcome screen / login" by Andrej Radisic to be really smooth and cool.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> As stated previously, I enjoyed "Welcome screen / login by Andrej Radisic". For this one, it is because of how chic it looks and incorporates an animation as a transition to the login screen. Other ones I enjoyed include: "Travel Map by Never-stop for Radio Design" and "Shopping App Transitions by Vlad Fedoseyev for Norde". They all seem like cooler versions of pre-existing applications. </p>
