        <h2>Part 2: Reading Responses</h2>
        <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-develop-an-eye-for-design-c5a4c64bb26c">Article discussed- "How to develop an eye for Design" by Kathleen Warner</a>
        <u1>
            <li>1. I learned to study apps by considering hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. By breaking down apps, I can develop a mindset viable for developing products and better applications in the future.</li>
            <li>2. My favorite part of the article was the "Breaking Down the App" portion, where there are a series of GIFs that help deconstruct applications to help emphasize apps. I appreciate this aspect of the article as it really goes to show the sophistication and careful attention to detail needed to create a functional and seamless product.</li>
            <li>3. My favorite quote from the article- "If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added to things, you would gasp in horror". This highlights that design is a learning process and that we all struggle at first, but with time and practice, we'll get better. This quote not only got a quick chuckle from me, but also serves as a sort of inspiration.</li>
            <li>4. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give this article a solid 7/10.</li>
